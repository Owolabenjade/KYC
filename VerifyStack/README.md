# Identity Verification Smart Contract

This Clarity smart contract provides a robust framework for identity verification processes, suitable for applications requiring KYC (Know Your Customer) and secure access management. It features administrative controls, audit trails, and secure credential handling, ensuring user data integrity and privacy.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Securely register new users with hashed credentials.
- **User Verification**: Authenticate user credentials against stored hashes.
- **Credential Updates**: Allow secure updates to user credentials by verified administrators.
- **Audit Trails**: Log each significant action taken within the contract, providing a transparent and traceable record.
- **Admin Controls**: Restrict sensitive actions to administrators, enhancing security and governance.
- **Block Height Logging**: Utilize the blockchain's block height as a timestamp for action logs.

## Requirements

- **Stacks Blockchain**: This contract is designed to run on the Stacks blockchain, which supports Clarity smart contracts.
- **Clarity Tools**: Development and testing require Clarity tools installed on your machine.

## Usage

### Deploying the Contract

Deploy the smart contract to a local or test Stacks blockchain.

```bash
clarinet deploy --contract identity-verification.clar
```

### Interacting with the Contract

#### Register a New User

```bash
clarinet console
(contract-call? .identity-verification register-new-user u1 '0x123...abc)
```

#### Verify a User's Credentials

```bash
(contract-call? .identity-verification verify-user-credentials u1 '0x123...abc)
```

#### Update User Credentials

```bash
(contract-call? .identity-verification update-user-hash u1 '0xdef...456)
```

## Testing

Describe how to run the unit tests for this system.

```bash
clarinet test
```

## Security

This project implements basic security controls; however, before deploying it in a production environment, conduct a thorough security audit to ensure it meets the required security standards.
